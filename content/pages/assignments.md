There are only two problems for this course. They are listed below.

Problem 1: Two-Dimensional Subsonic Flow Over Slender Bodies
------------------------------------------------------------

Using regular perturbation methods, derive the partial differential equations and boundary conditions for the perturbation velocity potentials φ{{< sub "n" >}}, n=0, 1, and 2.

Hint: For n=0, the PDE is: (1 - M{{< sub "∞" >}}{{< sup "2" >}})φ{{< sub "0xx" >}} + φ{{< sub "0xy" >}} = 0

Problem 2: Slender Body in Subsonic Flow
----------------------------------------

Consider a subsonic flow over a slender axially body of profile section

$$R(x)=\\frac{2tx(L-x)}{L^2}$$

where t is hte maximum thickness, L is the total length of the body,  and (t/L) \<\<1.

(a) Sketch the profile.

(b) Find the perturbation potential φ.

(c) Find the perturbation velocity component u=∂φ/∂x

(d) Find C{{< sub "p." >}}
