Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week; 1.5 hours / session; This is a half-semester course.

Prerequisites
-------------

[2.25 Fluid Mechanics](/courses/2-25-advanced-fluid-mechanics-fall-2013) or [18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I](/courses/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008)

Course Description
------------------

This subject is designed to inform students on the analytical foundations of inviscid subsonic aerodynamics. A primary goal of this subject is to equip students with the scientific rigor, applied mathematical complexity, and physical understanding that form the foundation of classical subsonic aerodynamics. Perturbation methods that both simplify mathematical complexity and expand physical understanding of critical phenomenon in fluid flow provides a framework for the subject. The subject offers lectures in classical subsonic aerodynamics at the graduate level on inviscid, subsonic, steady flow over slender aerodynamic bodies. Topics will be selected from: fundamentals of fluid mechanics \[review\]; singular-perturbation methods \[introduction, JIT\]; similitude; subsonic flows with axial symmetry; linearized subsonic flow; slender body theory; similarity rules for subsonic flows; two-dimensional flow past a wave-shaped wall; thin wing theory; Kaplanâ€™s higher approximations.

Guiding Thought
---------------

Throughout the course, mechanics, physical understanding and correct mathematical modeling are required to produce useful numerical simulations.

Subject Summary
---------------

This course aims to solve the compelling problems, including:

*   Transformations leading to Laplace equation
*   Two-dimensional, steady, inviscid, subsonic flow over slender bodies
*   Slender bodies of revolution
*   Wavy wall
*   Transonic flows
    *   No Laplace form
    *   Lateral flow field
    *   Highly nonlinear
    *   Method of local linearization
    *   Method of parametric differentiation

Class Participation
-------------------

Class participation is an essential part of the subject and students will be required to demonstrate knowledge of the lectures and readings. Students are expected to be able to offer critical assessment of the subject matter.
